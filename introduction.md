# Introduction

The world is in search of ways to increase the money velocity. Banking and government institutions set goals to stimulate this process. An increase in money velocity increases the economic activity of a particular territory, resulting in people's quality of life improvement (QOL is defined by the World Health Organization).

### **Current issues**

Free liquidity owners are in a constant search of effective ways to allocate their capital and currently these massive investments in microbusiness are a huge “uncaught whale".

This is a new market for investors that are ready to make profit from the invested capital in a shorter time. The second plus of investing in microbusiness is quick feedback which the investor receives through the platform in the form of information about the use of funds and the process of business growth. The third plus is the moral satisfaction an investor gets when sees visually the result of offline business development rather than virtual numbers.&#x20;

Microbusiness in its turn is experiencing difficulties in attracting capital for its growth. The issue becomes especially relevant due to the current transformation of the global financial system. Business is constantly facing the problems of banking bureaucracy and centralized models of bank scoring. Banks have not offered anything new for a long time and they don’t support business as actively as they could, while the cost of bank money is quite high and despite the high cost, there are still unbanked regions where banking services are difficult to obtain.&#x20;

Blockchain technology, smart contracts and the concept of the development of the Internet web 3.0 open up huge opportunities to create tools for financing microbusiness, where an ordinary customer can support his favorite coffee shop and further earn on its growth.

Technology is already making it possible to create a product that will raise the level of well-being in the world.
