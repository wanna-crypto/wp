# Platform

We offer the online social platform WANNA, which will allow anyone to invest in utilitarian microbusiness tokens and microbusiness will be able raise capital for the future growth and distribute utility tokens to its customers.&#x20;

The platform combines two groups of investors, which are divided according to a behavioral pattern.&#x20;

The first group of investors is the direct consumers of a product or service. People who have confidence in what the business offers, free liquidity to invest, a desire to earn, a desire to support business development. This community of investors will become the basis for controlling the targeted use of the capital attracted by the microbusiness.&#x20;

The second group of investors is experts in different fields of investment and are not tied to the location where the business is located. These are people who are crypto enthusiasts with free liquidity, ready to earn money by investing in microbusinesses from different countries.

### **Control of the targeted use of the investments**

The unification of two investor communities on the WANNA social platform makes it possible to control the targeted implementation of funds raised by the business. Investors who consume the products of the business personally can always monitor the growth of an offline business directly at its location. In case of any questions, address them to the business using the platform. Thereby raise the discussion on the project in the community and influence the change in the price of the token.&#x20;

The platform also allows businesses to receive direct feedback on their growth from the community, receiving the necessary expertise. Example: a business has chosen the right strategy, business models are calculated correctly. There is a direct communication between the business itself, investors and the platform community. The community can provide feedback and share expertise, for example, comment on the chosen business strategy, provide feedback on the calculations and business models.

### **Liquidity for microbusiness token trade.  Microbusiness token price**

After placing microbusiness tokens on the platform, the funds received at the time of the token presale will be used to ensure liquidity. Next, the price of the microbusiness token will change depending on the position on the “Token Bonding” curve. This will make it possible to always maintain a balance of demand and maintain the market price of an asset with an insufficient number of buyers/sellers.

### **Reinvestment of business profits into the network. Buybacks**

To confirm that the microbusiness is successfully developing using raised investments, the business buys tokens from the market for subsequent burning. The buyback percentage and other conditions are fixed in advance in the smart contract. Thus, the asset price will be backed up by real funds from the business profit.

### **Further microbusiness growth**

To attract funds for further growth, any business can place its token to other crypto exchanges. Such an opportunity will be implemented on the platform to do it just in a couple of clicks and will be available when the business reaches a certain threshold for the attracted funds.
