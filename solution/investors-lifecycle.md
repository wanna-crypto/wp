### **Registration**

Investors can appear on the platform through two main channels: offline, when a potential investor found out that the business, he is interested in and he is a consumer of, is placed on the WANNA platform or online, having seen information about the placement of business in marketing communications.

During registration on the platform, an investor also needs to go through the KYC/AML procedures provided by our partners. Next, an investor needs to bring free liquidity to the platform and build a portfolio of projects.

### **Locking in profits**

An investor has the right to withdraw from the project and lock in his profit at any time, all that is needed is to sell the purchased asset on the platform. The sale of the asset takes place algorithmically and does not require the investor to spend time searching for a buyer.

### **Community Interaction**

Throughout the lifecycle, an investor can take an active part in communication with any business, give feedback on its growth, share ideas and be a real participant in its growth.
