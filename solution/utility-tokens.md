Microbusinesses which will manage to implement tokenization into the existing business model before others will be handsomely rewarded. The WANNA platform will play a huge role in this process.

### **Marketing without compromising cash flow**

By issuing tokens, a business gets the opportunity to use future business revenues to finance growth today. For example, by making an airdrop and issuing tokens in the form of bonuses for participating in marketing activities.

The easiest option that projects will be able to apply in their business model is loyalty programs. By consuming a product or using any service, each client can earn tokens, which can later be held as a growing asset or exchanged for a product or service of another business. Such an approach allows you to create a secondary market and liquidity of tokens issued to consumers. An extra incentive in the rewards by tokens creates an upward shift in the demand curve for the microbusiness.

### **Consume to earn**

Let's consider the structure of the secondary market by the following example:

Take two microbusinesses, Sam's Coffee and AntiqBooks bookstore. The owner of AntiqBooks noticed that his customers often come to the shop with coffee, which was bought at Sam's Coffee and the idea arose to partner up with the coffee shop, increasing their customer base. Businesses are not competitors, but at the same time their customer base intersects, because customers often come to the coffee shop with books bought in AntiqBooks.

Sam's Coffee and AntiqBooks were registered on the WANNA platform and issued their tokens. Some of the tokens were allocated for marketing in the form of rewards for their customers.

There is a guy named Tom who likes to visit Sam's Coffee shop. He didn’t know about the existence of a AntiqBooks bookstore. Once having bought the 9th cup of coffee, the barista delighted Tom by offering him to participate in the loyalty program and earn tokens for every 9th cup of coffee purchased. Tom was happy with such a program, and his loyalty to the coffee shop grew even stronger. This time, the barista gave Tom the tokens of the AntiqBooks partner. That's how Tom found out about the existence of the bookstore.

Tom had a friend, Anna, who likes to read another recently released science-fiction book. Tom, who had some tokens of AntiqBools. shared a part with her. The next time Tom and Anna went to the store together and Tom used the rest of the tokens to buy the book “Freakonomics”, receiving a discount for using tokens.

Tom and Anna became interested in the possibilities of such hints and became permanent holders of coins on the Wanna platform. Anna invested in a coffee shop and became a long-term holder of its tokens. Tom became a major holder of bookstore tokens.

Sam's Coffee and AntiqBooks became the best partners and multiply the size of their businesses.
