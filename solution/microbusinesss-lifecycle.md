### **Placement on the platform**

In order for a business to appear on the platform, first of all any business needs to go through the internal KYC and AML procedure. Solutions from trusted partners, such as Refinitiv World-Check, Jumio are used to ensure the passage of these procedures on the platform.

After passing all the necessary procedures, the business needs to fill out a profile with marketing and financial materials and use our platform to evaluate the business.

### **Raising funds**

Upon completion of the placement process, the business needs to allocate a certain number of tokens for sale, fix the pre-sale price and then begin the procedure of forming a whitelist of investors. The process of forming a whitelist can take from several days to several months and is determined by the business itself, depending on the time required for marketing campaigns.

Upon finishing the whitelist formation, a presale takes place and funds are raised into a pool for further placement of tokens for open sale.

### **Vesting and token buyback**&#x20;

Tokens are released into the free management of the microbusiness through the vesting process. Vesting is set depending on the results set in advance at the time of issue, drawn up in the roadmap, which the microbusiness should achieve. The roadmap is one of the main documents offered to investors.

The microbusiness also in advance indicates the timing and volume of the planned token buyback.

### **Business development**

On the next step, the business will conduct its tokens according to the terms of the smart contract. Businesses will be able to sell tokens that will be unblocked under the smart contract and use attracted funds for the further growth.

The remaining tokens owned by the business continue to gain capitalization and grow in price along with the growth of the business.
