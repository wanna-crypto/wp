# Web3 & WANNA

The WANNA platform is a direct model of the Web 3.0 concept, which captures the work of the entire microbusiness segment from the real sector of each country's economy.

Our goal is to create such a situation when every consumer of a product can become a stakeholder of the business producing this product. This will create direct and rapid processes for getting feedback on the services provided by the business. This way the low-quality sector will be removed from the market and the best businesses in the opinion of the consumers will be supported.
